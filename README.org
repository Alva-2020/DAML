   - Tensorflow 1.14
   - colored
   - tqdm
*** Other
   - figlet (install from your system package manager, e.g. apt in Ubuntu or brew in MacOS)

** Guide
*** How to run
   To run the naive baseline, just run
   #+BEGIN_SRC
python train_naive.py --dataset SOURCE_DOMAIN --unlabeled_dataset TARGET_DOMAIN
   #+END_SRC

   To run any other model, just run
   #+BEGIN_SRC
python adv_train.py --model MODEL --dataset SOURCE_DOMAIN --unlabeled_dataset TARGET_DOMAIN
   #+END_SRC

*** Available models
    The following model names are available, just as filenames show:
    | dann | adversarial cross-domain training framerwork without Mutual Learning |
    | sml  | standard Mutual Learning framework                                   |
    | ml   | the proposed Mutual Learning framework                               |
    | ml3  | the proposed Mutual Learning framework with 3 models involved        |
    | ml4  | the proposed Mutual Learning framework with 4 models involved        |

*** Available datasets
    The following dataset names are available, just as shown in directory data/:
    - imdb
    - yelp13
    - elc (Amazon Electronics)
